# Be Less Fat! Be More Stronger

## Overall Goals

1. Be low-mid 70s for weight throughout the year
2. Increase your muscle imbalances, be all about function
3. Do not smoke; drink when it counts
4. Exercise 250 times - keep a record of that
5. Consistency beats intensity

## The Plan

### January

#### Diet

All about keto for ~6 weeks. This is what you can eat:

* meat and lots of it
* MCT oil
* almonds, walnuts, pecans, macadamia
* avocado
* whipping cream
* berries
* cheese
* 80% cocoa chocolate

What to never eat:

* rice
* non-fibrous bread
* sugar anything
* your beloved diet coke

#### Workout

Lift weights on Monday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday
Soccer on Tuesday

My main goal is for functionality; that needs to be build from the ground up. So the plan for that is as follows:

1﻿. When watching TV, roll your feet, calves, hamstrings, back, or hips.

2﻿. Activation needs to be at least 2 times a day. It can be done either first thing in the morning, 4:00, or before bed. Pick 2. 





### February

K﻿eep up with the keto until you reach ~75 kilos. The target for 75 kilos is sometime in February.

### March

### April

### May

### June
