# All Goals

Here is where I list all of the things that I want to do for the year.

::: details

`songs` here (the directory and contents) is used as an example of document directory that will be a collection in Decap CMS. The `index.md` files are within directories named in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

Update as needed.

```txt:no-line-numbers
. (Root)
├── docs
│   ├── .vuepress
│   │   │   ...
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── README.md

The pages have a standard format.
